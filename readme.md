# Readme
This project is part of the weekly assignment #2 of the BaSP-2022 course. It consists of a creation of a html page based on the design of the landing page made in the previous assignment, the Trackgenix SA webpage. We also learnt how to publish our projects to github, implementing commits accordingly.

The page was made in Visual Studio Code following the async material provided to us.
